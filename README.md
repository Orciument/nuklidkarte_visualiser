# Nuklide-Map Visualizer
This is my first rust project and is more for my own learning instead of being an actual product.
I was inspired to do this project while working with nuclide tables in physics class. 

This Project renders the Nuclide Map with each Nuclide being color coded and clickable to print the decay chain into the command Line.
